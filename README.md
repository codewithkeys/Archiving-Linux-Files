Archiving Linux Files on the Command Line

bunzip2
Description: Decompresses files compressed with the bzip2 algorithm.
Usage: bunzip2 filename.bz2
Details: This command removes the .bz2 extension and restores the file to its original form. It's effectively a shortcut for bzip2 -d.

bzcat
Description: Outputs the contents of a bzip2 compressed file without decompressing it to disk.
Usage: bzcat filename.bz2
Details: This is useful for viewing the contents of a compressed file without creating an intermediate uncompressed file.

bzip2
Description: Compresses files using the bzip2 algorithm.
Usage: bzip2 filename
Details: This command replaces the original file with a compressed version (e.g., filename.bz2). It's known for better compression ratios compared to gzip, though it can be slower.

gunzip
Description: Decompresses files compressed with the gzip algorithm.
Usage: gunzip filename.gz
Details: This command removes the .gz extension and restores the file to its original form. It's effectively a shortcut for gzip -d.

gzip
Description: Compresses files using the gzip algorithm.
Usage: gzip filename
Details: This command replaces the original file with a compressed version (e.g., filename.gz). gzip is faster than bzip2 but usually provides slightly less compression.

tar
Description: Manipulates tar archives by creating, listing, extracting, and updating.
Usage:
Create: tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2
Extract: tar -xvf archive.tar
List: tar -tvf archive.tar
Details: Commonly used with compression tools like gzip (.tar.gz) or bzip2 (.tar.bz2) to both archive and compress files in a single command (e.g., tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz file1 file2).

unxz
Description: Decompresses files compressed with the xz algorithm.
Usage: unxz filename.xz
Details: This command removes the .xz extension and restores the file to its original form. It's effectively a shortcut for xz -d.

unzip
Description: Decompresses and extracts the contents of a ZIP file.
Usage: unzip filename.zip
Details: This command extracts files from a ZIP archive, preserving the directory structure and file permissions if they were stored.

xz
Description: Compresses files using the xz algorithm.
Usage: xz filename
Details: This command replaces the original file with a compressed version (e.g., filename.xz). xz offers high compression ratios and supports multithreading.

zcat
Description: Outputs the contents of a gzip compressed file without decompressing it to disk.
Usage: zcat filename.gz
Details: Useful for viewing the contents of a compressed file without creating an intermediate uncompressed file.

zip
Description: Creates and compresses ZIP archives.
Usage: zip archive.zip file1 file2
Details: This command packages and compresses multiple files into a single ZIP file, supporting a variety of compression levels and encryption options.

Practical Examples:
Compress a file with gzip:
gzip myfile.txt
This will create myfile.txt.gz.

Decompress a file with gunzip:
gunzip myfile.txt.gz
This will restore myfile.txt.

Create a tar archive and compress it with bzip2:
tar -cvjf archive.tar.bz2 myfolder/
This will create a compressed archive archive.tar.bz2 containing the contents of myfolder.

Extract a tar archive compressed with xz:
tar -xvJf archive.tar.xz
This will extract the contents of archive.tar.xz.

Understanding these commands can significantly enhance your efficiency in managing and manipulating files, especially when dealing with large datasets or transferring files between systems.
